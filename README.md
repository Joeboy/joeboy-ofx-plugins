# joeboy-ofx-plugins

A place to put openfx video plugins, if I write any.

So far:

* QualiFlower, an effort at implementing something like Davinci Resolve's
  qualifier as an OFX plugin. Can be used to select by hue, saturation and
  luminance.

* TemporalAverage, an effort at doing a temporal averaging plugin, which I got
  some way into doing but didn't finish. Has bad hardcoded things in it. Don't
  try and use it. There's a "Temporal Blur" plugin in the Davinci Resolve
  developer examples, which I suspect does the same thing.
