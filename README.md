# joeboy-ofx-plugins

A place to put openfx video plugins, if I write any.

Currently there's just a sketchy temporal average plugin, which averages frames
with the previous and next frames. Hopefully it might be useful for removing
the sensor noise from my Canon DSLR footage, although I haven't really tried it
yet. It's not finished and has bad hardcoded things in it, so don't try to use
it unless you're happy to debug it and rewrite bits of it.
